# Voting Eligibility Checker
This Go program asks the user for their age and then determines if they are eligible to vote. It demonstrates basic Go programming concepts such as variable declaration, user input handling, conditional statements, and custom function definitions.

## Getting Started
These instructions will guide you through running the Voting Eligibility Checker on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
To run this program, you need to have Go installed on your machine. You can verify the installation by running the command "go version" in your terminal.

If you do not have Go installed, please follow the instructions on the official Go website to download and install it.

## Running the Program
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing your voteEligibility.go file.
2. Execute the program by running: go run voteEligibility.go
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your age and see whether you are eligible to vote.

## How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to enter their age.
2. It reads the user's input from the standard input.
3. A custom function checks if the age entered qualifies the user to vote according to the defined eligibility criteria (age >= 18).
4. The program outputs whether the user is eligible to vote based on the inputted age.
